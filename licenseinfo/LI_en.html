Confidentiality<br>
<br>
Licensee agrees to treat the following as "IBM Confidential 
Information" regardless of whether they contain restrictive markings 
indicating the confidential nature thereof or have been identified as 
IBM Confidential Information prior to disclosure: (a) the 
Program, (b) any information provided to Licensee by IBM with regard 
to the Program including, but not limited to, Program related 
materials such as specifications, plans, trends, strategies, 
benchmarks, performance characteristics, comparisons and other 
assessments of the Program, (c) any information related to Licensee's 
access to the Program including, but not limited to, passwords or 
other access codes, and (d) all data, feedback, suggestions 
and/or written materials that Licensee provides to IBM related to 
the Program. Licensee is authorized to use the IBM Confidential 
Information for the purpose for which it was disclosed or otherwise for 
the benefit of IBM. Notwithstanding any other terms of this 
Agreement, Licensee agrees not to communicate, publish, disseminate or 
otherwise discuss with or disclose to any third party the IBM 
Confidential Information (including but not limited to articles, papers 
or other written materials pertaining to the IBM Confidential 
Information) prior to IBM making such IBM Confidential Information 
publicly available without a non-disclosure obligation.<br>
<br>
Licensee agrees to use the same care and discretion to 
avoid disclosure of the IBM Confidential Information as Licensee 
uses with Licensee's own similar information that Licensee does 
not wish to disclose, but in no event will such degree of care 
be less than reasonable care. Licensee's obligations with 
respect to the IBM Confidential Information will continue for a 
period of two years from Licensee's receipt of the IBM 
Confidential Information. Licensee agrees not to disclose to IBM any 
information that is considered confidential or proprietary to Licensee 
or any third party except under a signed, separate, written 
confidential agreement.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding the existence of any confidentiality or 
other agreement Licensee may have with IBM pertaining to 
confidential information, the preceding paragraphs will govern the 
treatment of the IBM Confidential Information.<br>
<br>
