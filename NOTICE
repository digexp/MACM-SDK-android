   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND
DISTRIBUTION<br>
<br>
   1. Definitions.<br>
<br>
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for
use, reproduction,<br>
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9
of this document.<br>

      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of
such entity.<br>

Entity<br>
      exercising permissions granted by this License.<br>
<br>
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for

      source, and configuration files.<br>
<br>
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from
mechanical<br>
      transformation or translation of a Source form,
including but<br>
      not limited to compiled object code, generated
documentation,<br>
      and conversions to other media types.<br>
<br>
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in
Source or<br>
      Object form, made available under the License, as
indicated by a<br>
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to
the work<br>
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in
Source or Object<br>
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and
for which the<br>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or
other modifications<br>
      represent, as a whole, an original work of
authorship. For the purposes<br>
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include
works that remain<br>
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to
the interfaces of,<br>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship,
including<br>
      the original version of the Work and any
modifications or additions<br>
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is
intentionally<br>
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by
the copyright owner<br>
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to
submit on behalf of<br>
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this
definition, "submitted"<br>
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
communication sent<br>
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but
not limited to<br>
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source
code control systems,<br>
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on
behalf of, the<br>
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving

or otherwise<br>
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not
a Contribution."<br>
<br>
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual
or Legal Entity<br>
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by
Licensor and<br>
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br>
<br>
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and
conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable<br>
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative
Works of,<br>
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
distribute the<br>
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
form.<br>
<br>
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and
conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable<br>
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to
make, have made,<br>
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
transfer the Work,<br>
      where such license applies only to those patent
claims licensable<br>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
their<br>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
Contribution(s)<br>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If You<br>
      institute patent litigation against any entity
(including a<br>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that the Work<br>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
constitutes direct<br>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
licenses<br>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall
terminate<br>
      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute
copies of the<br>
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with
or without<br>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided
that You<br>
      meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry
prominent notices<br>
          stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any
Derivative Works<br>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent,
trademark, and<br>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the
Work,<br>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to
any part of<br>
          the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part
of its<br>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You
distribute must<br>
          include a readable copy of the attribution
notices contained<br>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
that do not<br>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in
at least one<br>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text
file distributed<br>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the
Source form or<br>
          documentation, if provided along with the
Derivative Works; or,<br>
          within a display generated by the Derivative
Works, if and<br>
          wherever such third-party notices normally
appear. The contents<br>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
only and<br>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own
attribution<br>
          notices within Derivative Works that You
distribute, alongside<br>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
Work, provided<br>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot
be construed<br>
          as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
modifications and<br>
      may provide additional or different license terms and
conditions<br>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
modifications, or<br>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided
Your use,<br>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise
complies with<br>
      the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly
state otherwise,<br>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for
inclusion in the Work<br>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
conditions of<br>
      this License, without any additional terms or
conditions.<br>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
supersede or modify<br>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may
have executed<br>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to
use the trade<br>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of
the Licensor,<br>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use
in describing the<br>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
law or<br>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and
each<br>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS"
BASIS,<br>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either
express or<br>
      implied, including, without limitation, any
warranties or conditions<br>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
FITNESS FOR A<br>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
determining the<br>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work
and assume any<br>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
under this License.<br>
<br>
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no
legal theory,<br>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
otherwise,<br>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
and grossly<br>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any
Contributor be<br>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct,
indirect, special,<br>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a<br>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability
to use the<br>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss
of goodwill,<br>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
any and all<br>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such
Contributor<br>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
redistributing<br>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
to offer,<br>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
warranty, indemnity,<br>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights
consistent with this<br>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
may act only<br>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
not on behalf<br>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
indemnify,<br>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
liability<br>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
Contributor by reason<br>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.<br>
<br>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
